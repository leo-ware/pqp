Welcome to ``pqp``'s documentation!
=======================================

``pqp`` (short for *pourquoi pas?*) provides tools for creating, visualizing, and performing causal identification on causal graphical models. The package aims to facilitate causal discovery and understanding for data scientists and researchers who may not be as familiar with Rust. ``pqp`` allows for the creation and visualization of causal diagrams through a simple and intuitive interface.

The underlying Rust library, ``pqp``, was designed for performant causal identification, with a focus on correctness. ``pqp`` leverages this capability by providing performant identification routines that can handle large graphs. The package is intended to be a tool for academic research and data analysis, and we hope it can aid in the advancement of knowledge in the field of causality.

**Please Note:** This package is still in development, and the API is subject to change. Additionally, not all features may work as advertised. We welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
