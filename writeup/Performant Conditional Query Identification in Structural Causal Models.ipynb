    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal inference is a fundamental task in many fields, including epidemiology, economics, and computer science. One popular framework for causal inference is Pearl's structural causal modeling framework, which utilizes directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and the do-calculus to explicitly model potential causal relationships. This approach allows for a clear and intuitive representation of causal assumptions, while also helping to avoid common biases that can arise with other methodologies. However, a crucial step in this framework is identification: translating a causal question into an abstract statistical estimator that can be estimated using a combination of a model and parametric assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important algorithm for identification in the structural causal modeling framework is Shpitser's algorithm for conditional interventional effects. This algorithm is polynomial time and guarantees a result when one is possible. However, existing open-source implementations of this algorithm are often incorrect, slow, or unmaintained. In this paper, we present a novel implementation of Shpitser's algorithm, written in Rust for efficient cross-functional use. Our implementation is designed for ease of use and includes extensive testing routines to ensure performance and correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper is organized as follows: in the first section, we provide an overview of the background and motivation behind the algorithm. In the second section, we describe our implementation in detail. In the third section, we provide examples to demonstrate the utility of our implementation. Appendices include code and HC/LO footnotes."

    "## Structural Causal Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural Causal Models (SCM) provide a framework for modeling the generating process of a distribution. A structural causal model has four components: a set of observed variables $\\textbf{V} = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$, a set of unobserved variables $\\textbf{U} = {u_1, u_2, ..., u_m}$, a distribution $P(U)$ over unobserved variables, and a set of functions $\\textbf{F} = {f_1, f_2...f_n}$ such that each $f_i$ is a function from a subset of $\\textbf{U} \\cup \\textbf{V} \\backslash V_i$ to $v_i$. The arguments to $f_i$ are called the parents of $v_i$ or $pa(v_i)$ and they uniquely determine the value of $v_i$. Together, $P(\\textbf{U})$ and $\\textbf{F}$ induce $P(\\textbf{V})$, a distribution over $\\textbf{V}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the causal assumptions in an SCM via a causal diagram. This is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node corresponds to a variable in the model. A directed edge from $x_i$ to $x_j$ indicates that the value of $x_j$ depends on the value of $x_i$, or $x_i \\in pa(x_j)$. To ensure the validity of an SCM, we restrict the set of valid models to those that can be represented by acyclic graphs, to prevent circular definitions between variables [1]. Algebraically, we can interpret a causal diagram as defining a set of conditional independence assumptions. In particular, as the parents of $v_i$ completely determine its value, $v_i$ will be independent of every other variable in the model, conditional on its parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this paper, we make the additional assumption that each unobserved variable is the parent of at most two observed variables. This simplifies the graphical representation by replacing each unobserved variable and its outgoing edges with a single undirected edge connecting its two children. This can be interpreted as representing potential confounding between the two variables. An example of such a simplified graph is shown in Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "[1] This does not restrict the class of distributions that can be represented by an SCM because by the definition of joint probability any joint distribution $P(x_1, x2…x_n)$ can be factorized as $P(x_1 | x_2…x_n)P(x_2 | x_3…x_n)...P(x_n-1 | x_n) P(x_n)$. But, this can be represented as an SCM where $pa(x_i) = \\{x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}…x_n\\}$ without violating the acyclicity assumption."

    "## Conditional Independence Properties of Causal Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key properties of causal diagrams is that they can provide insight into the conditional independence properties of a distribution $P(\\textbf{U} \\cup \\textbf{V})$. As previously discussed, a variable $v_i$ is independent of all other variables in the model, conditional on its parents. This concept of a \"flow of dependence\" along edges connecting a node to its parent is a useful tool for understanding the conditional independence assumptions encoded in a causal diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that dependence does not flow along every path in the diagram. Paths can be blocked by conditioning on certain variables, which alters the conditional independence properties of the distribution. We can view a path as a collection of vertices, each of which must have one of the following forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\leftarrow Y \\leftarrow Z$$\n",
    "$$X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z$$\n",
    "$$X \\leftarrow Y \\rightarrow Z$$\n",
    "$$X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first three cases, dependence will flow through the vertex as long as we do not condition on $Y$. In this case, we call the vertex unblocked. Conditioning on $Y$ blocks the path and prevents dependence from traveling along it. This means that, as long as this is the only path connecting $X$ and $Y$, the causal diagram is predicting that $X$ and $Z$ will be independent conditional on $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third case, known as a collider, is slightly different. The last vertex will be unblocked if and only if we condition on $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this concept, consider the example of college admissions. Without knowledge of whether a student was admitted, learning her SAT scores tells us nothing about her admissions essays. However, if we know that the student was admitted, and we observe that her SAT scores were low, we can infer that her essays must have been good.\n",
    "\n",
    "A path is considered blocked if any vertex along it is blocked. If, after conditioning on a set of variables $\\textbf{Z}$, there are no unblocked paths connecting two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$, then the model predicts that $v_i$ and $v_j$ are independent conditional on $\\textbf{Z}$. In this case, we say that $v_i$ and $v_j$ are d-separated by $\\textbf{Z}$. This concept of d-separation provides a means to connect the ideas of statistical association in the joint distribution with properties of the graph, and allows us to use graphical models of causal relationships to make testable predictions about datasets."

    "\n",
    "In causal inference, a fundamental task is to measure the causal effect of one set of variables, $X$, on another, $Y$. To operationalize this task within the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework, we utilize the concept of interventions. Specifically, in the SCM, the values of $X$ are determined by its parents, $pa(X)$. However, we are interested in understanding the effect of altering the value of $X$ through intervention, rather than allowing it to be set by its natural causes. To model this intervention process, we perform \"graph surgery\" by cutting all incoming edges into $X$, and examining the resulting interventional distribution. This allows us to isolate any remaining conditional effect of $X$ on $Y$, which can then be interpreted as a causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain further insight into this process, we can consider two types of paths that may connect $X$ and $Y$: backdoor paths and frontdoor paths. Backdoor paths are those that connect to $X$ through its parents, while frontdoor paths connect through its children. These paths represent different mechanisms through which $X$ may affect $Y$; frontdoor paths indicate direct causal effects, while backdoor paths indicate indirect effects through other variables (i.e. confounding). By performing graph surgery and cutting all backdoor paths, we effectively isolate any causal effects flowing through frontdoor paths.\n"

To illustrate, for sets of variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, the expression $P(Y | do(X), Z)$ represents the conditional probability $P(Y | X, Z)$ in the model that results from performing graph surgery on $X$. This represents a hypothetical scenario in which $X$ is fixed through intervention, rather than being determined by \"nature.\" A \"do-expression\" is any probability expression containing the do-operator.\n",

This is advantageous because it allows us to transform do-expressions, which cannot be estimated from the data, into traditional statistical estimands (e.g., $P(Y | X, Z)$), which can be estimated using parametric assumptions.\n",

    "## The Four Stages of Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured causal effect estimation is a four-step process consisting of modeling, identification, estimation, and robustness checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modeling: This step involves identifying plausible causal relationships in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG serves as a representation of the causal structure of the system being studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identification: Once the causal structure is represented in the form of a DAG, the next step is to translate a causal query into an abstract estimator in the context of these assumptions. This process is known as identification, and it is a crucial step in the process of causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Estimation: After the abstract estimator has been derived, the next step is to add parametric assumptions and pick a specific model to represent the abstract estimator. This model is then fitted to the data, and an estimate of the causal effect is extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Robustness checks: The final step is to assess the robustness of the analysis to the specifics of the assumptions made in the modeling process. This is done by perturbing the assumptions of the modeling process and determining the sensitivity of the analysis to these perturbations. These robustness checks are important for ensuring the validity and generalizability of the causal estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the modeling, identification, estimation and robustness checks are interrelated, and that making progress in one step may require revisiting the others."

    "## The Problem of Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that not every causal estimand can be unambiguously estimated in every model. Identification, or the process of determining the causal estimand from the joint distribution, may fail when it is impossible to unambiguously determine $P(Y | do(X))$ from $P$. Identification is always possible in a graph with no confounding, but in some cases it is not possible because it is not possible to disentangle the effect from possible confounding. For example, in a model with a bidirected edge between variables, it may be impossible to identify $P(Y | do(X))$ because any observed effect could be explained by confounding along the bidirected edge, and there is no way to control for this."

    "The rules of the do-calculus provide complete conditions for identification of causal estimands; if it is possible to convert the causal estimand to a statistical estimand, then it is possible using the do-calculus. However, manually applying the rules of the do-calculus to derive an abstract estimator is time-consuming and requires the researcher to make reference to complex properties of the causal graph, which is a task humans are ill-suited to, especially as the complexity of the graph grows. In the general case, it is too complex a task to be performed by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it is necessary to find algorithms by which identification can be performed automatically. This is a nontrivial problem; naive approaches often have exponential time complexity in the size of the graph, and the best algorithms, while polynomial time, rest on complex graph theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some researchers have simplified this problem by sidestepping direct application of the do-calculus and instead using the concept of adjustment sets. These methods rely on finding a set of variables which, when controlled for, block all backdoor-paths from the intervention set to the outcome set. However, these approaches face two distinct challenges. First, naive approaches to adjustment set search, such as those implemented in Knupple (2010), Breitling (2010), and Sharma (2020) rely on enumerating the set of all possible adjustment sets and then checking whether each successfully blocks all backdoor paths. This is an issue because the number of possible adjustment sets grows exponentially in the number of nodes in the graph. This makes these approaches infeasible for even fairly small graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "More efficient algorithms exist for adjustment set search, such as the one proposed in Textor and Liskiewicz (2011), which works in polynomial time. However, the drawback of these algorithms is that although every valid adjustment set corresponds to a valid statistical estimator for the query, not every valid statistical estimator can be represented as an adjustment set. Because these algorithms are only searching among adjustment sets, they fail in cases where other classes of estimator are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, in the famous front-door model, the interventional distribution $P(Y | do(X))$ is identified by the simple statistical estimator $P(Y | do(X)) = \\sum_z P(Z | X) \\sum_x P(Y | Z, X) P(X)$. This estimator works by breaking the problem into two subproblems: first identifying the interventional distributions $P(M | do(X))$ and $P(Y | do(M))$ and then combining these to identify $P(Y | do(X))$. Each subproblem can be solved using an adjustment set operator, but there is no adjustment set estimator which identifies $P(Y | do(X))$."

C-components, or connected components, are subsets of the graph that are connected via bidirectional (confounding) edges. Two nodes, $A$ and $B$, in a causal graph are in the same c-component if and only if there is a path from $A$ to $B$ that only follows bidirectional edges. It has been shown that any causal graph can be uniquely partitioned into a minimal set of c-components (Tian, 2002).\n",

This means that the problem of identifying $P(Y | do(X))$ can be broken down into a set of subproblems, one for each c-component in the graph $G \\backslash X$. This is the first critical insight that enables efficient identification and is known as c-component factorization.\n",

There are two kinds of graphs that I implemented: directed and bidirected graphs. The most important operations for the directed graph are to find ancestors of a given element or determine $\\text{d-separation}$. The most important operation for the bidirected graph is to find connected components.\n",

So, for example, a common question we might ask while executing the algorithm is: if we removed node $X$, would nodes $Y$ and $W$ still be in the same connected component? Or, if we intervened on $G$, would $A$ still be an ancestor of $B$? The most naive implementations of subroutines like these would be to copy the data from the original graph, modify the copy to reflect the operation, and then run the subroutine.\n",

    "## Simplification\n",
    "Simplification is an important step in computational identification because the ID algorithm tends to return symbolic expressions that are much more complex than they need to be. It is important to simplify the results for a couple of reasons. Simpler expressions are easier for humans to understand. They make it easier to test the program because they reduce the number of “correct” answers to an identification problem. And, maybe most importantly, simpler expressions are easier to evaluate numerically. It is both computationally cheaper and more accurate to simplify an expression before applying numerical estimation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whittemore, which I have borrowed from extensively, uses a heuristic-based simplification algorithm with just a couple of rules. My original plan was to just use this, but as I was implementing it I found a quirk in the way it simplifies certain quotients that I am 90% sure is a bug, although I haven’t gotten around to proving that it’s broken yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tikka and Karvanen (2017) describe a simplification routine that uses properties of the graphical model to find ways to reduce conditional terms. I was originally optimistic about this approach as it has nice guarantees on the degree of simplification. However, this approach has a time complexity that gorws significantly faster than exponential in the number of variables, and so would not prove practical for real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying on these solutions, I developed my own heuritsitc simplification algorithm.\n",

    "## Python Bindings\n",
    "While the focus of the Rust implementation is correctness and performance, the focus of the Python bindings is on elegance and usability. I used Python's magic methods to create an API for specifying and querying causal models that is extremely simple and readable. I created a website with documentation for the python library, and I have published it on PyPI."
