Welcome to sherlock_py's documentation!
=======================================

Sherlock_py provides a Pythonic interface for the powerful Rust library, Sherlock. The package aims to facilitate causal discovery and understanding for data scientists and researchers who may not be as familiar with Rust. Sherlock_py allows for the creation and visualization of causal diagrams through a simple and intuitive interface.

The underlying Rust library, Sherlock, was designed for performant causal identification, with a focus on correctness. Sherlock_py leverages this capability by providing performant identification routines that can handle large graphs. The package is intended to be a tool for academic research and data analysis, and we hope it can aid in the advancement of knowledge in the field of causality.
