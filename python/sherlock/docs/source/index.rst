Welcome to ``sherlock_py``'s documentation!
=======================================

``sherlock_py`` provides a Pythonic interface for the powerful Rust library, ``sherlock``. The 
package aims to facilitate causal discovery and understanding for data scientists and 
researchers who may not be as familiar with Rust. Sherlock_py allows for the creation 
and visualization of causal diagrams through a simple and intuitive interface.

The underlying Rust library, ``sherlock``, was designed for performant causal identification, 
with a focus on correctness. ``sherlock_py`` leverages this capability by providing performant 
identification routines that can handle large graphs. The package is intended to be a tool 
for academic research and data analysis, and we hope it can aid in the advancement of knowledge
in the field of causality.
